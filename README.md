Goutham's CodeAlpha Internship Tasks
This project highlights my work, skills, and projects in Python programming and development.

Project Overview
The Simple URL Shortener website is built using the Flask web framework and showcases my expertise in Python, web development, and database management. The frontend is crafted with HTML and Bootstrap, while the backend leverages SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations.

Key Features:

Flask: Backend web framework for managing server-side logic.
SQLAlchemy: ORM for seamless database interactions.
HTML/Bootstrap: Frontend technologies for creating a responsive and interactive user interface.
This Simple URL Shortener takes a long URL as input and converts it into a shorter version.
